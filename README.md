# ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction in the Telecom Sector Using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Abstract
Customer churn is a critical issue in the telecom industry, often resulting in lost revenue and increased marketing costs. Retaining existing customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project proposes a machine learning-based solution to predict customer churn using various classification algorithms.

Machine learning techniques â€” including KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, LGBM, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost â€” were employed to analyze customer data and identify churn patterns. Among them, **LGBM** and **XGBoost** achieved the highest accuracy of **95.74%**.

This project highlights the power of predictive analytics in customer retention strategies and provides actionable insights to telecom providers aiming to reduce churn.
